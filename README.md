# mathlive-keyboard-essay

I have a learndash site. For the quizzes - I want that the users will be able to add mathematical symbols to the essay questions. Implement mathlive so that one can enter text normally to a text field but with a click on a button on screen or writing $$ in the field the mathlive keyboard will popup.
